// Let's consider an e-commerce application where customers can place orders for various products. When a customer
// places an order, the application needs to perform various tasks asynchronously to process the order efficiently.
// Here's how the asynchronousMethodsExample() method could be applied in such a scenario:

import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

//In this example, when a customer places an order (Order object), the processOrderAsync() method is invoked to
// process the order asynchronously. This method simulates various tasks related to order processing
// (such as payment processing, inventory update, and shipping) being performed asynchronously using
// CompletableFuture.runAsync(). While the order is being processed asynchronously, the application can continue
// executing other tasks (performOtherTasks() method). Once the order processing is completed, the application can
// proceed with other tasks or send an order confirmation to the customer.

        // Continue executing other tasks while the order is being processed
        performOtherTasks();
